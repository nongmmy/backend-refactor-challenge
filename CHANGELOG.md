# Changelog

All changes to this project will be documented in this file.

### Changed

- Break down the monolithic API into domain microservices. Each microservice has it's own database: User Service, Product Service and Order Service.
- Microservices communicate with each other using api requests. 
- Restructure all service structure to follow Clean Architecture principles.
- Apply SOLID principles, dependency injection, making it easier to test and extend.
- Enable api versioning support.

### Added

- New endpoint to product service: Get product details
- New endpoint to product service: Update product details
- New endpoint to order service: Search all orders
- Unit tests
- New postman request collection for supporting new endpoint
- Environment variables, making it easier to run local.
